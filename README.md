## Digit Recogniser

This is a digit recogniser based on the MNIST dataset.
MNIST is called the "hello world" of Computer Vision.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

### The Model achieves an accuracy of '98.96' with ReLU activation without CNN

### The Model achieves an accuracy of '98.65' with Swish activation without CNN
